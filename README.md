## Physicochemical Properties Prediction of Chemical Substances with Hybrid-GICN

- A novel approach for predicticing physicochemical properties of chemical substances using Graph Representation Learning approach. 
- For prediction, A unique, hybrid approach of graph convolutional and graph isomorphism neural network is used.
